Rouge Access Point Attack Toolkit

Academic Title: Small form factor Wireless Auditing and Penetration Kit 
Commercial Title: LokiPi

The wireless penetration test has become a staple of the information technology security audit. It is a systematic measurement and evaluation of a companyâ€™s network security posture, helping to provide a service to expose potential vulnerabilities that arise from incorrect system configuration, software flaws and operational weaknesses.

This project offers a penetration tester or security auditor, a small form factor portable concealable wireless auditing kit. Although small this implementation still retains enough power to host a full- fledged Linux security distribution with its accompanying flexibility. By controlling and interfacing with the kit through a mobile device or initiating an automated attack directly from an on-board LCD interface, the auditor can draw less attention from security employees onsite by concealing obvious wireless equipment.

The device incorporates methods for circumventing SSL encryption and trust exploitation with rouge access points, man in the middle attacks, deep packet inspection, and automatic vulnerability assessment and exploitation. It can also be utilized as a network tap creating a backdoor into an organization through an automated reverse SSH tunnel.
